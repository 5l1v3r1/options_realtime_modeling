## Abstract
This paper explores the Black-Scholes-Merton options pricing model, derives a predictive extension model, and visualizes both models in comparison to real-time pricing options pricing. The paper also explores various methodologies of calculating historical volatility. A portfolio of 5 U.S. Market Stocks and 1 index fund was taken as example for the project. The model was limited to visual analysis from real-time simulations as further explained in the extensions
## Overview 
The project was written in python. The Jupyter notebook is a reference of how to interact with the `option_.py and pytradier.py` files. 
To configure the Library to run, rename the `config_example.json` file as `config.json` and enter your own details. You will need to get the required API keys, as well as install the python dependencies. 
A sample of the generated 3D volatility surfaces is shown below.

## Math 
Please reference the paper/latex file in the GitHub for specifics on the Math behind each model.
